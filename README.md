# Timewarp Art Excercise

Hi!

This is an assessment exercise for prospective Timewarp team members in the Art / Digital Assets area.

# Task

Objective: Implement a relatively simple sprite and animation combination for a character in a 2D game world. More specifically:

- Take or create a 2D art asset for a simple pig character that has a head and at the very least simple arms and legs, but potentially clothing or other details,
- Create a sprite for the character that could be used in a game,
- Create one simple animation for the character such as idle, walking, jumping, or going to sleep, (one is enough, but two or three would be ideal),
- The technique used can be anything (Frame by Frame, Rig, Inverse Kinematics etc.). Again, one is enough, more than one would be ideal.
- Ensure that the sprite and animations can be imported and used in a Unity project.

The assessment will not be about the art style of the character itself, but the resulting asset and its usability within the game environment. The design style can be top-down, side view, or whatever you prefer. (See here for some information on [Mafia Pigs art style](https://www.notion.so/03-03-Concept-Art-Mafia-Pigs-01ecb4d9518f46f796d4d33f0edc599e), but there is no obligation to use this.)

The original pig asset could be created by you (not required!) or taken from any web, or public example.  

Ideal delivery would be in a Unity project (either by GitHub, or sharing the file with Google drive, dropbox etc.) but if you prefer to do something else please let us know what it is. This Github rpository contains a simple starter project that you can fork or copy to work on. However, feel free to start your own new Unity project. 

# Rules

There are not many rules: 

- We'll be looking at the result by importing into unity, so please ensure this works,
- Feel free to use any tools you like and find useful,
- Ask us if you have any questions,
- The project should not take more than a couple of hours, if it is taking much longer than that please ask us about it and/or feel free to stop with a partial result.
